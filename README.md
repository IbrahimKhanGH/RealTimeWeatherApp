Real-Time Weather App was one of the first chances I have gotten to scratch the surface of web development. I began the project during the summer of 2022 during my free time, where I did a little research on building websites. The idea to develop this application came from me walking outside in the scorching Texas heat, where I realized that I needed to know the weather before I planned on going outside. And instead of just looking at the weather app on my phone, I decided I would create one. This project focuses on mainly front-end development, where I utilized a multitude of languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as utilizing a weather API to access weather information globally. Although with this project is just the tip of the iceberg for web development, it made me eager to learn more in the field.
